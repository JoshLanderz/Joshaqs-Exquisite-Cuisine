# Joshaqs-Exquisite-Cuisine
#JoShaqâ€™s Exquisite Cuisine, located in Brittons Hill, St. Michael, is a small business owned by Jonele and Shaqoun Graham. They specialize in baking and catering to events.

The name of the business was created by the owners who combined their names together (Jonele and Shaquon) to get "JoShaq's", and the "Exquisite Cuisine" was to introduce a form of elegance.

The system we have in place will allow the owners to operate faster, easier, and most importantly online. With a database connection, orders and inquiries can be recorded safely.
